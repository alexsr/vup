# VUP - Variable Unified Particle Simulation Framework

In this project I am trying to create a variable particle simulation framework
utilizing OpenGL Compute Shaders and OpenGL 4.5. It is supposed to include a
majority of currently available simulation techniques already, but should also
be easily expandable by providing a modular infrastructure. At least that's the
plan.

In my bachelor's thesis I already implemented a particle simulation framework
using technologies such as OpenGL, OpenCL and JSON. This is going to be a
complete reimplementation using Compute Shader which should yield better
results.
